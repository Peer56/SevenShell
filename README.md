HOW TO USE
-Put a clean FE7U ROM in the root directory named "FE7_clean.gba".
-Run MakehackFull.cmd.
If build is successful, EA will output a second ROM called "FE7_hack.gba".

MakehackQuick.cmd will do the same thing as MakehackFull.cmd excluding text and
tables. This builds a lot faster but any changes made to text and tables will be
ignored until you run MakehackFull.cmd.

FE7J support is planned. Some EA stuff might already work with FE7J but there
will be full support for it later regardless.
